# Drone-Based Runway Inspection System

This project focuses on using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to inspect airport
runways for cracks, surface damage, and Foreign Object Debris (FOD).

## Problem Statement
Manual runway inspection is time-consuming, costly, and risky. There is a need
for a faster and safer inspection system.

## Proposed Solution
A drone equipped with a high-resolution camera is used to capture runway images.
These images can be analyzed to detect cracks and foreign objects.

## Objectives
- Improve runway safety
- Reduce inspection time
- Minimize human risk
- Provide accurate inspection data

## Tools & Technologies
- Drone
- Camera
- Python (for image processing – future scope)
- OpenCV (future scope)

## Applications
- Airports
- Defense airstrips
- Emergency runways
